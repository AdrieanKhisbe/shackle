  "Association list of rules what to do with windows.
Each rule consists of a condition and a property list.  The
condition can be a symbol, a string or t.  If it's a symbol,
match the buffer's major mode.  If it's a string, match the name
of the buffer.  Use the following option in the property list to
use regular expression matching:

:regexp t

If the condition is t, turn the property list into the fallback
to use for every invocation of `display-buffer' with an unmatched
condition.

The property list accepts the following keys and values:

:select t

Make sure the window that popped up is selected afterwards.  Use
this option on its own or in combination with :reuse.
Alternatively set `shackle-select-reused-windows' to make this
the default for reused windows.

:same t

Don't pop up any window and reuse the currently active one.

:reuse t

Try reusing a window already displaying the target buffer.  Use
this in combination with `shackle-preserve-emacs-defaults' set to
nil to have the described behaviour for certain buffers only.
Alternatively use it as fallback rule to change only the
`switch-to-buffer' behaviour while keeping this Emacs default.

:frame t

Pop to a frame instead of window.

To make an exception to a fallback rule, use the condition you
want to exclude and either not use the key in question, use a
different value or use a placeholder as key."
