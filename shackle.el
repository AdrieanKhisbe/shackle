  "Association list of rules what to do with windows.
Each rule consists of a condition and a property list.  The
condition can be a symbol, a string or t.  If it's a symbol,
match the buffer's major mode.  If it's a string, match the name
of the buffer.  Use the following option in the property list to
use regular expression matching:

:regexp t

If the condition is t, turn the property list into the default
for every invocation of `display-buffer'.

The property list accepts the following keys and values:

:select t

Make sure the window that popped up is selected afterwards.

:reuse t

Don't pop up any window and reuse the currently active one.

To make an exception to a default rule, use the condition you
want to exclude and either not use the key in question, use a
different value or use a placeholder as key."
