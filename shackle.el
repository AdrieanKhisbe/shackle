It may be one of the following values:

'above: Align above the currently selected window.

(defcustom shackle-rules nil
  "Association list of rules what to do with windows.
Each rule consists of a condition and a property list.  The
condition can be a symbol, a string or t.  If it's a symbol,
match the buffer's major mode.  If it's a string, match the name
of the buffer.  Use the following option in the property list to
use regular expression matching:

:regexp and t

If the condition is t, turn the property list into the fallback
to use for every invocation of `display-buffer' with an unmatched
condition.

The property list accepts the following keys and values:

:select and t

Make sure the window that popped up is selected afterwards.  Use
this option on its own or in combination with :reuse.
Alternatively set `shackle-select-reused-windows' to make this
the default for reused windows.

:same and t

Don't pop up any window and reuse the currently active one.

:reuse and t

Try reusing a window already displaying the target buffer.  Use
this in combination with `shackle-preserve-emacs-defaults' set to
nil to have the described behaviour for certain buffers only.
Alternatively use it as fallback rule to change only the
`switch-to-buffer' behaviour while keeping this Emacs default.

:align and t or either of 'above, 'below, 'left and 'right

Align the popped up window at any of the specified sides or the
default size (`shackle-default-alignment') by deleting all other
windows, then restore the window configuration after the window
has been \"dealt\" with by either burying its buffer or deleting
the window.

:ratio and a floating point value between 0 and 1

Use this option to specify a different ratio than the default
value of 0.5 (`shackle-default-ratio`).

:defer and t

Use this option to defer cleaning up an aligned window.  This is
used to avoid errors with Emacs packages that clean up their
buffers themselves and rely on their window being kept open until
they finally delete it themselves, such as `helm'.

:frame and t

Pop to a frame instead of window.

To make an exception to a fallback rule, use the condition you
want to exclude and either not use the key in question, use a
different value or use a placeholder as key."
